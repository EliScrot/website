      <h1>What is Power League</h1>
      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;"> Power League is a competitive ranking system added to the game in season 5. This replaced the Power Play system. Players unlock this system at 4500 trophies. There are a total of 19 ranks between bronze one and master. Each season lasts two months. At the end of a Power League season, players gain Star Points based on their rank. Players can enter Power League solo or with teams of three. The winner is decided on a best-of-three format and ties do not count. Each match starts the game randomly choosing a game mode and map. All players from both teams choose a Brawler to ban. All six players in the match must play with a different Brawler. Players in the team can switch Brawlers with each other if they have the specific Brawler unlocked. Progression is varied based on various factors including the opponents ranks.&nbsp;</p>
